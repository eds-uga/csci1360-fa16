    "### Marie is getting married tomorrow at an outdoor ceremony in the desert. In recent years, it has rained only 3 days each year. Unfortunately, the weatherman has predicted rain for tomorrow. When it actually rains, the weatherman correctly forecasts rain 95% of the time. When it doesn't rain, he incorrectly forecasts rain 5% of the time. What is the probability that it will rain on the day of Marie's wedding?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, you'll need to use Bayes' Theorem. Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) * P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll call event A \"it rains\", and event B \"the weatherman forecasts rain.\" What is $P(A | B)$, or the probability of rain given that the weatherman has predicted rain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You can rewrite $P(B)$ using the chain rule of probability to be: $P(B | A ) * P(A) + P(B | !A) * P(!A)$, where `!` means \"negation\", or the opposite.\n",
