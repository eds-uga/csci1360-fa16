The raw notebook itself is a [JSON file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON); not something we really want to have to mess with ourselves. However, the whole point of these fancy Jupyter notebooks is that they're supposed to allow interactivity. What's the point if, in the end, they're just glorified HTML?\n",
