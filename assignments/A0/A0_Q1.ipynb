    "[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) are interactive web-based notebooks that can be viewed in multiple formats--HTML, PDF, even as lecture slides (as you'll see next week!)--and can also execute embedded code. In essence, they're an incredible instructional tool.\n",

    "JupyterHub is a multi-tenant platform on which users can interact with Jupyter notebooks. Normally, one has to run a Jupyter notebook on a server in order for its interactivity to function properly. While Jupyter itself comes with a local server, this doesn't really help in the case of wanting to provide interactive versions to many users at once--say, a class of students. That's where JupyterHub comes in: I can release a single notebook, and every time someone requests to view it, a new server instance is spun up so *everyone gets their own copy to edit*. No Google-docs-ing each other's edits.\n",
